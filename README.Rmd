# DabomAsotinSthd

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KevinSee/DabomAsotinSthd/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the data and code for running the **D**am **A**dult **B**ranch **O**ccupancy **M**odel ([DABOM](https://github.com/KevinSee/DABOM)) for adult steelhead returning past the Asotin weir in the Asotin River. This model estimates escapement past various locations in the Asotin basin using detections of PIT tagged fish. The full methods are described in the paper:

> `r Author`, (`r Year`). _`r Title`_. `r Journal`  <https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2202>

The most recent estimates for various spawn years can be found in the "outgoing/estimates" folder that is available after cloning or downloading this compendium. There is a manual describing the step-by-step instructions to generate these results, found in the "analysis/paper" folder. 

The user can find more information related to installation and use of the [PITcleanr](https://kevinsee.github.io/PITcleanr/) and [DABOM](https://kevinsee.github.io/DABOM/) packages on their package websites.


## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: R_scripts](/analysis/R_scripts): various R scripts. The 
  filenames are numbered to show what order they should be run in.
  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for a manual. Includes code to reproduce the analysis for example dataset. 
    It also has a rendered version,
    `manual.html`, suitable for reading (the code can be toggled on/off).
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations
  - [:file\_folder:
    supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):
    Supplementary materials including notes and other documents
    prepared and collected during the analysis.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/manual.Rmd` and knit to produce the `manual.html`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/manual.Rmd")` in the R console
